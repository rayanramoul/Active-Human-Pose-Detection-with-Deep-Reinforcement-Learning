# Active Human-Pose-Detection with Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
Considering human-pose estimation as a MDP (Markov Decision Process), the goal is to train 2 types of agents :
- One fort the localization of humans on the image.
- A group of agents for the second type, dedicated to the localization of keypoints of the human pose.
